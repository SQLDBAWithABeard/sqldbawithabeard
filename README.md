### 👋 My Name is Rob - refer to me as He/Him please 

:revolving_hearts: [Sponsor Me](https://github.com/sponsors/sqldbawithabeard)  

I was a SQL Server DBA with a passion for Powershell, Azure, Automation, and SQL (PaaS geddit?) (and a sense of humour (and a habit for writing inside braces)). Now I just helps other people with those (not the braces bit).
